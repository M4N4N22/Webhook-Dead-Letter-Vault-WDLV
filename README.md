**Never lose another webhook. Ever.**

Webhook Dead-Letter Vault is a bulletproof webhook relay service built on Filecoin Onchain Cloud that automatically captures, stores, and replays failed webhook events with cryptographic integrity guarantees.

## 🚨 The Problem

Webhooks fail. When they do, it's silent, costly, and often undetected until customers complain:

- **23% of webhooks fail in production** across all major providers
- Failed payment webhooks = lost revenue, chargebacks, customer churn
- Failed integration webhooks = broken workflows, data inconsistencies
- Most startups have **zero retry logic or dead-letter storage**

**Real impact:** Stripe, Shopify, and AWS all invest heavily in retry infrastructure because webhook failures are *expected*, not exceptional.

## ✨ The Solution

WDLV transforms fragile webhooks into **immortal event streams** with one line of code:

```javascript
// Before: Hope and pray 🙏
webhook.send(payload)

// After: Bulletproof reliability 🛡️
webhook.via('wdlv://your-vault-id').send(payload)
```

### Key Features

- **🛡️ Automatic Vaulting** - Failed webhooks instantly stored in Filecoin
- **🔄 Smart Retries** - Exponential backoff with configurable policies
- **📋 Audit Trail** - Immutable history with cryptographic proofs
- **⚡ Fast Replay** - On-demand event replay via FilCDN
- **💰 Usage-Based Pricing** - Pay only for failed events via Filecoin Pay
- **🔍 Real-Time Monitoring** - Live dashboard showing vault activity

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install webhook-dead-letter-vault
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import { WebhookVault } from 'webhook-dead-letter-vault'

const vault = new WebhookVault({
  vaultId: 'your-vault-id',
  filecoin: {
    warmStorage: true,
    cdnReplay: true,
    payStreaming: true
  }
})

// Send webhook with automatic vaulting on failure
await vault.relay({
  url: 'https://api.yourapp.com/webhooks/payment',
  payload: { event: 'payment.succeeded', amount: 5000 },
  headers: { 'x-signature': 'sha256=...' }
})
```

### Advanced Configuration

```javascript
const vault = new WebhookVault({
  vaultId: 'your-vault-id',
  retryPolicy: {
    maxAttempts: 5,
    backoffMultiplier: 2,
    maxDelay: 3600 // 1 hour
  },
  onFail: (event) => console.log(`Vaulted: ${event.id}`),
  onRetry: (event) => console.log(`Retry #${event.attempt}`),
  onSuccess: (event) => console.log(`Delivered: ${event.id}`)
})
```

## 📦 API Reference

### WebhookVault Class

#### Constructor Options

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `vaultId` | `string` | Unique identifier for your vault | Required |
| `retryPolicy` | `RetryPolicy` | Retry configuration | See defaults |
| `filecoin` | `FilecoinConfig` | Filecoin service settings | `{}` |

#### Methods

##### `relay(options)`

Send a webhook with automatic vaulting on failure.

```javascript
await vault.relay({
  url: 'https://example.com/webhook',
  payload: { data: 'value' },
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer token' },
  timeout: 30000,
  idempotencyKey: 'unique-key'
})
```

##### `replay(eventId)`

Manually replay a vaulted webhook event.

```javascript
const result = await vault.replay('event_123')
console.log(result.status) // 'success' | 'failed' | 'retrying'
```

##### `getVaultStats()`

Get vault statistics and health metrics.

```javascript
const stats = await vault.getVaultStats()
// { totalEvents, successRate, vaultedEvents, activeRetries }
```

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests covering:

- Webhook delivery and failure scenarios
- Filecoin storage integration
- Retry logic and backoff policies
- Dashboard functionality
- Error handling and edge cases

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- --grep "vault storage"

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Docker

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t webhook-vault .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e FILECOIN_WARM_STORAGE_API_KEY=your_key \
  -e VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_key \
  webhook-vault
```

### Production Considerations

- **Scaling**: Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with your observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana)
- **Security**: Rotate encryption keys regularly
- **Backup**: Filecoin provides redundancy, but consider backup policies
- **Compliance**: Audit logs are immutable and cryptographically verified
